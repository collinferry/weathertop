# Weathertop
A Lord of the Rings themed weather app that uses geolocation.

The page displays local temperature using data pulled from the Open Weather API in JSON format.

A different LOTR background displays based on the current weather type (sun, rain, snow, clouds, storm). There is also a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celcius.
